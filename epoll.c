  Here are the values we're masking off to decide what operations to do.
  Note that since EV_READ|EV_WRITE.

  Note also that this table is a little sparse, since ADD+DEL is
  nonsensical ("xxx" in the list below.)

  Note also also that we are shifting old_events by only 3 bits, since
  EV_READ is 2 and EV_WRITE is 4.

  The table was auto-generated with a python script, according to this
  pseudocode:

      If either the read or the write change is add+del:
	 This is impossible; Set op==-1, events=0.
      Else, if either the read or the write change is add:
	 Set events to 0.
	 If the read change is add, or
	    (the read change is not del, and ev_read is in old_events):
	       Add EPOLLIN to events.
	 If the write change is add, or
	    (the write change is not del, and ev_write is in old_events):
	       Add EPOLLOUT to events.

	 If old_events is set:
	       Set op to EPOLL_CTL_MOD [*1,*2]
	Else:
	       Set op to EPOLL_CTL_ADD [*3]

      Else, if the read or the write change is del:
	 Set op to EPOLL_CTL_DEL.
	 If the read change is del:
	     If the write change is del:
		 Set events to EPOLLIN|EPOLLOUT
	     Else if ev_write is in old_events:
		 Set events to EPOLLOUT
		Set op to EPOLL_CTL_MOD
	     Else
		 Set events to EPOLLIN
	 Else:
	     {The write change is del.}
	    If ev_read is in old_events:
		 Set events to EPOLLIN
		Set op to EPOLL_CTL_MOD
	    Else:
		Set the events to EPOLLOUT

      Else:
	   There is no read or write change; set op to 0 and events to 0.

      The logic is a little tricky, since we had no events set on the fd before,
      we need to set op="ADD" and set events=the events we want to add.	 If we
      had any events set on the fd before, and we want any events to remain on
      the fd, we need to say op="MOD" and set events=the events we want to
      remain.  But if we want to delete the last event, we say op="DEL" and
      set events=(any non-null pointer).

  [*1] This MOD is only a guess.  MOD might fail with ENOENT if the file was
       closed and a new file was opened with the same fd.  If so, we'll retry
       with ADD.

  [*2] We can't replace this with a no-op even if old_events is the same as
       the new events: if the file was closed and reopened, we need to retry
       with an ADD.  (We do a MOD in this case since "no change" is more
       common than "close and reopen", so we'll usually wind up doing 1
       syscalls instead of 2.)

  [*3] This ADD is only a guess.  There is a fun Linux kernel issue where if
       you have two fds for the same file (via dup) and you ADD one to an
       epfd, then close it, then re-create it with the same fd (via dup2 or an
       unlucky dup), then try to ADD it again, you'll get an EEXIST, since the
       struct epitem is not actually removed from the struct eventpoll until
       the file itself is closed.

  EV_CHANGE_ADD==1
  EV_CHANGE_DEL==2
  EV_READ      ==2
  EV_WRITE     ==4
  Bit 0: read change is add
  Bit 1: read change is del
  Bit 2: write change is add
  Bit 3: write change is del
  Bit 4: old events had EV_READ
  Bit 5: old events had EV_WRITE
