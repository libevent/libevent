Changes in current version:
 o allow \r or \n individually to separate HTTP headers instead of the standard "\r\n"; from Charles Kerr.
 o demote most http warnings to debug messages
 o Fix Solaris compilation; from Magne Mahre
 o Add a "Date" header to HTTP responses, as required by HTTP 1.1.
 o Support specifying the local address of an evhttp_connection using set_local_address
 o Fix a memory leak in which failed HTTP connections whould not free the request object
 o Make adding of array members in event_rpcgen more efficient, but doubling memory allocation
 o Fix a memory leak in the DNS server
 o Fix compilation when DNS_USE_OPENSSL_FOR_ID is enabled
 o Fix buffer size and string generation in evdns_resolve_reverse_ipv6().
 o Respond to nonstandard DNS queries with "NOTIMPL" rather than by ignoring them.
 o In DNS responses, the CD flag should be preserved, not the TC flag.
 o Fix http.c to compile properly with USE_DEBUG; from Christopher Layne
 o Handle NULL timeouts correctly on Solaris; from Trond Norbye
 o Recalculate pending events properly when reallocating event array on Solaris; from Trond Norbye
 o Add Doxygen documentation to header files; from Mark Heily
 o Add a evdns_set_transaction_id_fn() function to override the default
   transaction ID generation code.
 o Add an evutil module (with header evutil.h) to implement our standard cross-platform hacks, on the theory that somebody else would like to use them too.
 o Fix signals implementation on windows.
 o Fix http module on windows to close sockets properly.
 o Make autogen.sh script run correctly on systems where /bin/sh isn't bash. (Patch from Trond Norbye, rewritten by Hagne Mahre and then Hannah Schroeter.)
 o Skip calling gettime() in timeout_process if we are not in fact waiting for any events. (Patch from Trond Norbye)
 o Make test subdirectory compile under mingw.
 o Fix win32 buffer.c behavior so that it is correct for sockets (which do not like ReadFile and WriteFile).
 o Make the test.sh script run unit tests for the evpoll method.
 o Make the entire evdns.h header enclosed in "extern C" as appropriate.
 o Fix implementation of strsep on platforms that lack it
 o Fix implementation of getaddrinfo on platforms that lack it; mainly, this will make Windows http.c work better.  Original patch by Lubomir Marinov.
 o Fix evport implementation: port_disassociate called on unassociated events resulting in bogus errors; more efficient memory management; from Trond Norbye and Prakash Sangappa
