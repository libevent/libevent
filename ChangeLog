Changes in version 2.1.2-alpha (18 Nov 2012)

 Libevent 2.1.2-alpha includes more portable for monotonic timers,
 refactors much of Libevent's internal and external infrastructure,
 closes some longstanding gaps in the interface, makde other
 improvements.  Ths log below tries to organize features by rough area of
 effect.  It omits a few commits which were pure bugfixes on other commits
 listed below.  For more detail, see the git changelogs.  For more
 insight, see the "whatsnew-2.1.txt" document included in the Libevent
 2.1.2-alpha distribution.

 Libevent 2.1.2-alpha also includes all changes made in 2.0.19-stable
 through 2.0.21-stable inclusive.

 Performance (core):
   o Replace pipe-based notification with EVFILT_USER where possible. This
     should make multithreaded programs on OSX and *BSD alert the main thread a
     little faster. (53a07fe)
   o Make th_base_lock nonrecursive. (9cd5acb)

 New/Changed API Functions:
   o New event_get_priority() function to return an event's priority (f90e255)
   o Add a bufferevent_get_priority() function (bd39554)
   o Add an event_base_loopcontinue() to tell Libevent to rescan for more
     events right away (7d6aa5e)
   o Add a new callback to get called on evbuffer_file_segment free
     (e9f8feb yangacer, 64051b9)
   o Expose event_base_foreach_event() as a public API. (84fd6d7 Roman
      Puls, 232055e, ffe1643)
   o Add an event_remove_timer() to remove timer on an event without
     deleting it (e3b2e08)
   o Make bufferevent_set_timeouts(bev, NULL, NULL) have plausible
     semantics (9dee36b)
   o Rename event_enable_lock_debuging() to ..._debugging(). (The old name
     should still work.) (07e132e)
   o Add missing implementation for event_enable_debug_logging (3b3e21d)

 PORTABLE MONOTONIC TIMERS:

   Libevent 2.1.2 includes internal support for monotonic timers on
   (nearly) all supported platforms, including Windows, and OSX.  Libevent
   applications should now be more resilient to jumps forwards or backwards
   in the system clock.  Also, on Linux systems with epoll, we now
   optionally support microsecond-level timeouts (whereas epoll only
   supports millisecond-precision timeouts).

   o Use mach_absolute_time() for monotonic clock support on OSX. (b8fd6f9)
   o Do not track use_monotonic field when is no monotonic clock (cb653a0)
   o EVENT_BASE_FLAG_PRECISE_TIMER indicates we want fine timer precision
     (ddd69d3)
   o On Linux, use CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE by default (55780a7)
   o Implement a GetTickCount-based monotonic timer for Windows (d5e1d5a)
   o Refactor monotonic timer handling into a new type and set of
     functions; add a gettimeofday-based ratcheting implementation (f5e4eb0)
   o Add EVENT_PRECISE_TIMER environment var for selecting precise-but-slow
     timer (a2598ec)
   o Implement fast/precise monotonic clocks on Windows (2c47045)
   o Simple unit tests for monotonic timers (630f077)
   o Improve the monotonic-time unit test: make it check the step size (7428c78)
   o When PRECISE_TIMERS is set with epoll, use timerfd for microsecond
     precision (26c7582)
   o Split out time-related evutil functions into a new evutil_time.c (c419485)
   o Split out time-related prototypes into time-internal.h (71bca50)
   o Add evutil_time.obj to Makefile.nmake (0ba0683)
   o Avoid giving a spurious warning when timerfd support is unavailable
     (1aaf9f0 Dave Hart)
   o Make test_evutil_monotonic a little more tolerant (def3b83)
   o Avoid unused-var warning on systems with clock_gettime but without
     CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE (9be5468)

EVENT_BASE_ONCE LEAKS:
   If a callback added by event_base_once() is never invoked, Libevent no
   longer leaks internal memory.

   o Free dangling event_once objects on event_base_free() (c17dd59)
   o Add a unit test in which an event is created with event_base_once()
     but never fires (4343edf)

TESTING SUPPORT, FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS:

   Libevent now disables by default its unit tests that would touch the
   network, or that tend to fail on heavily-loaded systems.  To re-enable
   them, invoke the ./test/regress program with the @all alias.

   o Simplify test.sh code significantly. (9b856fd Ross Lagerwall)
   o Make all tests that hit the network disabled by default (f2cea87)
   o Avoid a resource leak on error in http client benchmark (ea92fba)
   o Update to latest tinytest (911b4f0349377) (ef7c4f7)
   o Avoid (unlikely) overflow in bench_httpclient.c (5671033)
   o Shave 700 msec off the persistent_timeout_jump test (21205b8)
   o Check return value of write() in regress.c (c8009d2)
   o Make load-dependent monotonic timer tests off-by-default (2b6fe8b)
   o Add deferred_cb_skew to list of timing-dependent tests (34c8f31)
   o Avoid test -e; older shs don't have one. (f1bd938)
   o Fix renegotiation test to work around openssl 1.0.1 bug (c2f3086)
   o Fix a couple of compile warnings in the unit tests (5a9a014)

MISC:
   o Change evutil_weakrand_() to avoid platform random() (e86af4b Nicholas
     Marriott, 3aa4415)

INFRASTRUCTURE (Active-later events):
   As a simplification and optimization to Libevent's "deferred callback"
   logic (introduced in 2.0 to avoid callback recursion), Libevent now
   treats all of its deferrable callback types using the same logic it uses
   for active events.  Now deferred events no longer cause priority
   inversion, no longer require special code to cancel them, and so on.

   o Refactor the callback part of an event into its own event_callback
     type (cba59e5)
   o Add "active later" event_callbacks to supersede deferred (745a63d)
   o event_base_assert_ok: check value of event_active_count for
     correctness (fec8bae)
   o Replace deferred_cbs with event_callback-based implementation. (ae2b84b)
   o Replace more deferred_cb names with event_callback (a4079aa)
   o Give event_base_process_active a single exit path (581b5be)
   o Restore our priority-inversion-prevention code with deferreds (c0e425a)
   o Refactor event_persist_closure: raise and extract some common logic
     (bec22b4)
   o Remove the unused bits from EVLIST_ALL (9889a3d)

BUILD IMPROVEMENTS:
 Libevent 2.1.2-alpha modernizes Libevent's use of autotools, and makes
 numerous other build system. Parallel builds should be faster, and all
 builds should be quieter.

   o Split long lists in Makefile.am into one-item-per-line (2711cda)
   o Remove unnecessary code in configure.in. (e65914f Ross Lagerwall)
   o attempt to support OpenSSL in Makefile.nmake (eba0eb2 Patrick Pelletier)
   o Use newer syntax for autoconf/automake init (7d60ba8)

   o Switch to non-recursive makefiles (7092f3b)
   o Rename subordinate Makefile.ams to include.am (6cdfeeb)
   o Make quiet build even quieter (371a123)

   o Be quiet when making regress.gen.[ch] (607a8ff)
   o Fix handling of no-python case for nonrecursive make (1e3123d)
   o We now require automake 1.9 or later. Modernize! (b7f6e89)

   o Use the same CFLAGS for openssl when building unit tests as with
     libevent (1d9d511)

DOCUMENTATION
   o Note that make_base_notifiable should not be necessary (26ee5f9)
   o Be more clear that LEV_OPT_DEFERRED_ACCEPT has tricky prereqs (371efeb)
   o Add caveat to docs about bufferevent_free() with data in outbuf (6fab9ee)
   o Make it more clear that NOLOCK means "I promise, no multithreading"
    (9444524)
   o Fix a comment in test-fdleak after 077c7e949. (3881d8f Ross Lagerwall)
   o Make the Makefile.nmake warning slightly less dire (e7bf4c8)
   o Fix typo : events instead of evets (05f1aca Azat Khuzhin)
   o Additional comments about OPENSSL_DIR variable, prompted by Dave Hart
     (6bde2ef Patrick Pelletier)

EVHTTP:
   o ignore LWS after field-content in headers (370a2c0 Artem Germanov)
   o Clean up rtrim implementation (aa59d80)
   o Remove trailing tabs in HTTP headers as well. (ac42519)
   o Remove internal ws from multiline http headers correctly (c6ff381)

Changes in version 2.1.1-alpha (4 Apr 2012)

 Libevent 2.1.1-alpha includes a number of new features and performance
 improvements.  The log below tries to organize them by rough area of
 effect.  It omits some commits which were pure bugfixes on other commits
 listed below.  For more detail, see the git changelogs.  For more
 insight, see the "whatsnew-2.1.txt" document included in the Libevent
 2.1.1-alpha distribution.

 Performance: Core
   o Replace several TAILQ users with LIST. LIST can be a little faster than
     TAILQ for cases where we don't need queue-like behavior. (f9db33d,
     6494772, d313c29, 974d004)

     timeout (e47042f, 09cbc3d)
   o Remove a needless base-notify when rescheduling the first timeout (77a96fd)
   o Save a needless comparison when removing/adjusting timeouts (dd5189b)
   o Possible optimization: split event_queue_insert/remove into
     separate functions. needs testing (efc4dc5)
   o Make event_count maintenance branchless at the expense of an
     extra shift. Needs benchmarking (d1cee3b)
   o In the 2.1 branch, let's try out lazy gettimeofday/clock_gettime
     comparison (2a83ecc)
   o Optimization in event_process_active(): ignore maxcb & endtime
     for highest priority events. (a9866aa Alexander Drozdov)
   o Bypass event_add when using event_base_once() for a 0-sec timeout (35c5c95)
   o Remove the eventqueue list and the ev_next pointers. (604569b 066775e)

 Performance: Evbuffers
   o Roughly 20% speed increase when line-draining a buffer using
     EVBUFFER_EOL_CRLF (5dde0f0 Mina Naguib)

   o Save some syscalls when creating evdns sockets (713e570)
   o Save some syscalls when constructing a socket for a bufferevent (33fca62)
   o Prefer epoll_create1 on Linuxen that have it (bac906c)

 Performance: Epoll backend
   o Use current event set rather than current pending change when
     deciding whether to no-op a del (04ba27e Mike Smellie)
   o Replace big chain of if/thens in epoll.c with a table lookup (8c83eb6)
   o Clean up error handling in epoll_apply_one_change() a little (2d55a19)

 Performance: Evport backend
   o evport: use evmap_io to track fdinfo status. Should save time and
     RAM. (4687ce4)
   o evport: Remove a linear search over recent events when
     reactivating them (0f77efe)
   o evport: Use portev_user to remember fdinfo struct (276ec0e)
   o evport: don't scan more events in ed_pending than needed (849a5cf)
   o evport: Remove artificial low limit on max events per getn call (c04d927)
   o Reenable main/many_events_slow_add for evport in 2.1 (e903db3)

 Performance: Windows

   o bufferevent: Add functions to set/get max_single_read/write
     values. (998c813 Alexander Drozdov)
   o bev_ssl: Be more specific in event callbacks. evhttp in particular gets
     confused without at least one of BEV_EVENT_{READING|WRITING}. (f7eb69a

     event-private.h (321b558 Kevin Bowling)
   o Remove internal usage of _GNU_SOURCE (3b26541 Kevin Bowling)
   o Eliminate a couple more manual internal _GNU_SOURCE defines (c51ef93

   o Do not define WIN32 in Makefile.nmake (d41f3ea Peter Rosin)
   o Provide the autoconf m4 macros for the new OpenSSL via pkg-config

   o We need AM_CPPFLAGS when compiling bufferevent_openssl.c (6d2613b
     Harlan Stenn)
   o Fix OSX build: $(OPENSSL_INCS) needs to be after
